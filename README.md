This repo holds demo code from my Atlanta Code Camp talk: _Keeping Your Sanity With User Interface Automation_.

The project's a Visual Studio 2012 solution and uses the C# bindings for WebDriver and the NUnit test runner. The talk is about concepts, more than syntax, with the goal that attendees discuss and apply them to most languages and web automation tools.
